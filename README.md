# More Viash Examples...

This repository contains some more examples of using [viash].

In time, it may even turn into one of those fancy cookbook-like tutorials.

The following examples are available in this repository:

## `md2html`

A very simple component, a wrapper around `pandoc` that does not even define a custom script.

## `md2html2`

This component adds a script that calls `pandoc` and in the meantime also includes a custom `pandoc` yaml configuration file (`config.yaml`) for styling the output html file.
