# More Viash Examples...

This repository contains some more examples of using [viash].

In time, it may even turn into one of those fancy cookbook-like tutorials.

## Components

The following examples are available in this repository:

### `md2html`

A very simple component, a wrapper around `pandoc` that does not even define a custom script.

### `md2html2`

This component adds a script that calls `pandoc` and in the meantime also includes a custom `pandoc` yaml configuration file (`config.yaml`) for styling the output html file.

### `knit`

This component processes code blocks. It is derived from the [viash_docs](https://github.com/data-intuitive/viash_docs/tree/master/examples/knit) examples.

## Illustration

Create the `md` file using

```
viash run src/markdown_tools/knit/knit.vsh.yaml -- README.Rmd README.md --format github_document
```

Or, you could test it out like this as well:

```
ENDPOINT="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/data-intuitive/more_viash_examples/main/src/markdown_tools/knit/knit.vsh.yaml"
viash run $ENDPOINT -- README.Rmd README.md --format github_document
```

```{sh}
pandoc -h
```
